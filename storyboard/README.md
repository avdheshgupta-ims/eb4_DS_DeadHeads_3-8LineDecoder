## Storyboard (Round 2)


Experiment 1: 3-8 Line Decoder

### 1. Story Outline:

In digital electronics, a decoder can take inputs in the form of 1 or 0. It has 3 bits inputs and 8 outputs. The coded 3x8 Decoder converts coded inputs into coded outputs, where the input and output codes are different e.g. n-to-2^n, binary-coded decimal decoders. 

### 2. Story:

A decoder is a n-to-2^n type binary decoders. The Decoder is a digital circuit which is a combinational circuit that convert coded binary information from 'n' coded inputs to a maximum of 2^n unique coded outputs. Few examples of Decoder are: 2-to-4 decoder, 3-to-8 decoder or 4-to-16 decoder. The simulator display the complete circuit diagram with truth table. The user will test the truth table based on different inputs.
Let us consider that a logic network has 3 inputs A, B and C. Their output will be as per the eigth states as mentioned below. 


#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
A clear visualization of circuit diagram or logic diagram with block diagram on simulator page. It show the Logic diagram, Block diagram and truth table. The proper animation is ther to verify the truth table of 3x8 Decoder. 

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| 
:--|:-- |
1.| User will be able to explain the basic knowledge of logic circuit.
2.| User will be able to interpret the output of digital circuit.
3.| User will be able to apply the flow of input and how the output will be displayed.

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

The simulator tab will follow:<br>
<br>1. On the simulator tab, click ON/OFF button to enable or disable for the desired Input
<br>2. Click on RUN Button
<br>3. It show the desired output and also block diagram will show the input and output in binary
<br>4. Click on clear, and check other inputs and repeat step 1-3



##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Q.1) How many input in a decoder, if there are 16 output:
<br><b>a.	4</b>
<br>b.	2
<br>c.	3
<br>d.	5

Q.2) Can a decoder design with NAND Gate:
<br><b>a.	Yes</b>
<br>b.	No

Q.3)	There is always n input and 2^n output in any decoder.
<br><b>a.	Yes</b>
<br>b.	No



##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
Combinational logic circuits 3x8 Decoder has been designed and simulated using logic gates.

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
As the AND Gate out is depends on the input given to AND gate, and the output of AND Gate will be true if all inputs are 1. Therefore:<br>
O0 = A’B’C’
<br>O1 = A’B’C
<br>O2 = A’BC’
<br>O3 = A’BC
<br>O4 = AB’C’
<br>O5 = AB’C
<br>O6 = ABC’
<br>O7 = ABC
