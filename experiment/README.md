### Aim
<br>In this experiment you will learn to design 3x8 Decoder and verify the truth table of 3x8 Decoder.<br>
### Theory
A decoder would be the n-to-2n type binary decoders. These types of decoders are combinational circuits that convert binary information from 'n' coded inputs to a maximum of 2n unique outputs. In case the 'n' bit coded information has unused bit combinations, the decoder may have less than 2n outputs. 2-to-4 decoder, 3-to-8 decoder or 4-to-16 decoder are other examples.<br>
### Procedure
<br>
1.	On the simulator tab, click ON/OFF button to enable or disable for the desired Input
<br>2.	Click on RUN Button
<br>3.	It show the desired output and also block diagram will show the input and output in binary
<br>4.	Click on clear, and check other inputs and repeat step 1-3

### Pre Test
<br>Ques1. What are the two types of circuits?
a.	Combinational and Mixed Circuit
b.	Sequential and Mixed Circuit
c.	Combinational and Sequential Circuit
<br>Ques2. Can we design any circuit by using Single Type of Universal Gates Only?
a.	Yes	
b.	No

### Post Test<br>
Ques1. What is the output of decoder if input is 001
a.	I0
b.	I1
c.	I2
d.	I7
<br>Ques2. How many output in a decoder is there will be 5 inputs.
a.	5
b.	32
c.	10
d.	16
<br>Ques3. How many output in decoder if input will be n.
a.	2n
b.	2n
c.	n/2
d.	n
