<h3><b>2.Theory</b></h3>
<p>A decoder would be the n-to-2n type binary decoders. These types of decoders are combinational circuits that convert binary information from 'n' coded inputs to a maximum of 2n unique outputs. In case the 'n' bit coded information has unused bit combinations, the decoder may have less than 2n outputs. 2-to-4 decoder, 3-to-8 decoder or 4-to-16 decoder are other examples.</p>
