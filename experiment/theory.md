<h3><b>2.Theory</b></h3>
<p>Decode is an electronic circuit designed from basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) and can take multiple decoded input and provide multiple outputs. The circuit of decoder is a combinational circuit. A decoder would be the n-to-2^n type binary decoders. The decoder convert binary information from 'n' coded inputs to 2^n outputs. 2-to-4 decoder, 3-to-8 decoder or 4-to-16 decoder are some examples of Decoder. Decoder is basically used to enable one of the circuit amoung multiple circuit.</p>
