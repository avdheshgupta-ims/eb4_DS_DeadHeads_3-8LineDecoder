<p>Decode is and electronic circuit made from basic logic gates and can take multiple input and provide multiple outputs. The circuit design of decoder is a combinational circuit. A decoder would be the n-to-2^n type binary decoders. These types of decoders are combinational circuits that convert binary information from 'n' coded inputs to a maximum of 2^n unique outputs. 2-to-4 decoder, 3-to-8 decoder or 4-to-16 decoder are some examples of Decoder. Decoder is basically used to enable one circuit amoung multiple circuit. One example of usage of decoder is in multiple memory blocks, in which only one memory block is active at a time.</p>
