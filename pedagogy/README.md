#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>  Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessments

<u> <b>Description: </b> </u>
<br>
Student has to follow instructions from digital circuit design (combinational circuit) and then compare the results obtained with predetermined outcomes already known to us.

<br/>
<u> <b>Simulator: </b> </u>
<br>
n coded input (3 input) and then passing the combination of 3 bits to designed circuit gives 2n output.

<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to apply to their learning of digital circuit | Designing a circuit with Basic gates and identify the output at each stage| What is the output of 1+1 in XOR Gate:<br><b>a) 0 </b><br>b) 1<br>c) 0 with carry 1<br>
2.| User will be able to design combinational circuit of Decoder| Design the full circuit with 3 input and 8 output | If a Decoder has n input then the output will be<br>a)2n<br>b)n<br><b>c)2^n</b><br>
3.| User will be able to evaluate the truth table of 3 x 8 Decoder| Check the output based on 3 bits input|The output of Decoder will be if input is 111<br>a)O5<br>b)<b>O7</b><br>c)<O0<br>d)O8<br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>
1. Simulator accept 3 bits inputs from users
2. Pass this 3-bits input to designed combinational circuit and check 
3. Output will vary with different combinations of 3 bits input
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Design a visual display of logic gates used in Decoder| Start the simulator and click on start:<br>Show the gates used in designing Decoder| To show the Logic gates used in designing 3x8 Decoder
2.| Design the Decoder step wise | Click on next:<br>It will show step wise designing of Decoder | To show how inputs are connected and how the circuit will design.
3.| Check the output based on 3 bits input|Click on next:<br>Show the output based on various inputs.<br>The user can also give input and Decoder will show the output and verify the truth table | Show and verify the truth table of 3x8 Decoder
