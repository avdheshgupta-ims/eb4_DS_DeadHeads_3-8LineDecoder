#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>  Expository 
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessments

<u> <b>Description: </b> </u>
<br>
Student has to follow instructions from digital circuit design (combinational circuit) and then compare the results obtained with predetermined outcomes already known to us.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. 
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to explain to their learning of digital circuit | The use can give inputs to the circuit and understand the diagram | What is the output of 1+1 in XOR Gate:<br><b>a) 0 </b><br>b) 1<br>c) 0 with carry 1<br>
2.| User will be able to interpret the output of digital circuit | Check the output of Decoder with 3 input and 8 output | If a Decoder has n input then the output will be<br>a)2n<br>b)n<br><b>c)2^n</b><br>
3.| User will be able to apply the the knowledge of logic gates to learn the working of decoder | The user can find the flow of current and visualize how the output is generated. |The output of Decoder will be if input is 1001<br>a)O5<br>b)<b>O9</b><br>c)O0<br>d)O8<br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| The user need to gives input to Decoder | The output will show | To verify the output based on the input given by the user.
2.| The user can give different inputs to decoder | The output will show as per the truth table | To verify the truth table of decoder.
