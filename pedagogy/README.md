#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>  Reinforce theoretical concepts: The user understands topics after seeing the simulator visually, and learn/recall their knowledge.
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessments

<u> <b>Description: </b> </u>
<br>
Student has to follow instructions from digital circuit design (combinational circuit) and then compare the results obtained with predetermined outcomes already known to us.

<br/>
<u> <b>Simulator: </b> </u>
<br>
n coded input (3 input) and then passing the combination of 3 bits to designed circuit gives 2n output.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. 
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to apply to their learning of digital circuit | The use can give inputs to the circuit and understand the diagram | What is the output of 1+1 in XOR Gate:<br><b>a) 0 </b><br>b) 1<br>c) 0 with carry 1<br>
2.| User will be able to interpret the output of digital circuit | Check the output of Decoder with 3 input and 8 output | If a Decoder has n input then the output will be<br>a)2n<br>b)n<br><b>c)2^n</b><br>
3.| User will be able to extend their learning in other digital circuits | The user can check the output and able to apply/extend their knowledge in evaluating other digital circuits. |The output of Decoder will be if input is 111<br>a)O5<br>b)<b>O7</b><br>c)O0<br>d)O8<br>
4.| User will be able to analyse the flow of input and how the output is calculated | The user can check the flow of current and check how the output is generated. |The output of Decoder will be if input is 1001<br>a)O5<br>b)<b>O9</b><br>c)O0<br>d)O8<br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>
1. The first page display the design of Logic diagram 3x8 Decoder and Block Diagram of 3x8 Decoder.<br>
2. The user need to enter the value of input in Logic diagram of decoder.<br>
3. The simulator will show the output based on the truth table available at simulator page.<br>

<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Click on show Simulator | Show the complete design odf 3x8 Decoder| To show the Logic gates used in designing 3x8 Decoder and show the complete design of 3x8 Decoder.
2.| The user need to gives input to Decoder | Simulator show the green signal that it is one or on | To show the input value given by the user
3.| Click on RUN | The simulator will show how the input is goes to circuit and how output is generated | To verify the truth table of 3x8 decoder
4.| Click on CLEAR | The simulator clears all the input | To check another output based on another input
5.| Repeat the step 2,3 and 4| The simulator behave like step 2,3,4 | To check and verify the complete tructh table
