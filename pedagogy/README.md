#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>  Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessments

<u> <b>Description: </b> </u>
<br>
Student has to follow instructions from digital circuit design (combinational circuit) and then compare the results obtained with predetermined outcomes already known to us.

<br/>
<u> <b>Simulator: </b> </u>
<br>
n coded input (3 input) and then passing the combination of 3 bits to designed circuit gives 2n output.
